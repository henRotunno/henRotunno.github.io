The project I have chosen is near and dear to me as I love to study history. It is titled: "The Fallen of WWII." This project aims to visualize data from all fronts of the war, counting civilians and soldiers separately. On YouTube, it is just a video. But on the official website, you can interact with the chart providing you have a good computer.

I did this assignment first and accidentally deleted it trying to troubleshoot git (whoops) but the knowledge I gained from the second assignment has given me a better idea on how the website was built. 

To start off, the entire project/website was coded by the Neil Halloran. It also appears there were data volunteers helping out with the project, but most of the data came from wikipedia and government records. I found Neil's GitHub but he didn't have a repository for the project.

Even though Neil's website is a lot cleaner than the one I made, I feel like I can visualize the code for it. I see a ton of links to various sources, social media pages, and a book. There was also a lot of indentation/playing with the margins to ensure a clean looking website.
